todaysToday's study shows me how to use the basic GitHub of learning open source hardware, how to search some code on the Internet, and how to write my own code. Know how to use git to connect with websites and push and modify each other. And also saw some excellent open source hardware. Today, I have gained a lot and have a certain understanding of open source hardware.
